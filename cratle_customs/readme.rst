UK Customs Declarations
=============================
This module submits import and export declarations to UK customs.  They are routed via a UK customs broker who checks
the declaration on its way to HMRC.

Whilst your first declaration is free, we make a charge for each declaration after that.
The money is used to reinvest in the module and to pay the port authorities for access to their systems.

Configuration
=============
All document codes are included in the data/ directory but only a few are loaded automatically.  Those that are loaded
automatically are sufficient for a simple import and export declaration.  It is suggested that the ones that are
necessary for your declarations are loaded, rather than loading the whole set.
