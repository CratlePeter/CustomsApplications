1010/2009.","Use status code XX (see document status codes for harmonised declarations for definitions). This document code is to be used for fish/fish products which are listed in Annex 1 of Regulation 1005/2008  as not requiring a catch certificate.

Note: document code Y927 is not required for those fish/fish products falling within commodity codes that are completely excluded from the scope of the Regulations. Example: eels caught in marine waters declare code C673; eels caught in fresh water declare code Y927; eels from acquaculture, obtained from fry or larvae declare code Y927. Freshwater crayfish, however, are not subject to IUU control and therefore no document code should be declared.

(These examples were correct at time of printing and are intended to assist in deciding which document code is declared or if one is necesssary. This advice is not definitive and you should check current regulations in The Official Journal of the EU or with lead department Defra).",
